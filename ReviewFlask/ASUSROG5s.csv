ASUSROG5s,Flipkart Customer,4,Value-for-money,Its good classy phone.If you face heat issues-1)Dont use x mode only use while playing game.2)Select refresh rate to 60 Hz for daily use.While playing game you can select 120 Hz.And for who dont know why there is no 90 fps for pubg then wait one update will come and 90 fps would be enabled.Phone is good but could be a bit cheaper.

ASUSROG5s,Thejus Rao,5,"As someone who is not a mobile gamer, just BUY it!","Really love this phone. For any new potential buyers who are not happy with the battery, update to the latest firmware, THEN factory reset the phone, and disable 5g (India doesn't have it anyway). It'll fix everything, I promise you.Pros:- A monster of a battery. Lasts me 2+ days under heavy usage. Check the screenshot attached- An amazing display. Color reproduction is great, very vivid and no notches or punch-holes. Only downside is the curved corners.- Speakers. Best in class, enough ..."

ASUSROG5s,Vikrant Sharma,4,Nice product,"The phone is a winner in performance as it is built keeping in mind a specific audience (gamers). Camera quality is okay not really great but people who are really into taking photographs everywhere may not like it on this one. Battery backup is good but I don't know I didn't feel a really big difference while I was gaming the whole time maybe it lasted a bit longer, but can't say that the difference between 6000 mah on this one and 4500 mah on other phones which seems really great is actuall..."
